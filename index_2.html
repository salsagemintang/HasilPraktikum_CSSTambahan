              <p>Much of this is regular text, but some of it is <span>fancy</span>! We
              can use our <span>newly fancified font</span> to add some
              <span>flair</span> to our website. It'd be a <span>royal pain</span> to
              make each of these span tags <span>fancy</span> individually,
              but it's a cinch with
        <span>CSS</span>!</p> </body>
